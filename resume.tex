\tag{Python} \tag{Swift} \tag{SwiftUI} \tag{Machine Learning}

A macOS app that scans your Apple Photos library and creates an album of each unique face found. This was inspired by Apple Photos' lack lustre built in facial clustering. The application uses the Photos API to find the pictures, then starts up python subprocesses  to cluster the faces. Some challenges for this project included code signing python for the App Store, and tweaking the model to get sufficient accuracy.}
